# Django-Practise

Here are basic projects that I've made in the process of learning Django. I'll be uploading more into the repo as I progress.
## Environment Setup:
  To use same version of tools as were used during development please setup your virtual environment with the settings in requirements.txt to make sure things don't break with a different version.
  - $ pip install -r requirements.txt    
   
## STEPS to run for each project:
  - clone the repository in your local device
  - Head towards the particular project folder
  - navigate to the folder containing manage.py for that project
  - $ python manage.py runserver
  - navigate to localhost:8000
  (some projects' entry app may be in different routes, see more in project description below)
